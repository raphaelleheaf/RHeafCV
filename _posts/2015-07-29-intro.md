# I'm a freelance communications & brand strategist.
{: .text-purple}

I'm based in London and I can help with digital marketing & product strategy as well as community development and user engagement. I've previously worked with a number of high growth startups and in one of the world’s best technology teams, [Government Digital Service](https://gds.blog.gov.uk/about/) to help them launch and grow their user base. I'm also a [social media marketer](https://www.instagram.com/raphaelleheaf/), an [entrepreneur](https://uk.linkedin.com/in/raphaelleheaf), a [blogger](http://nevercinderella.com/) and a bit of a [geek](https://github.com/raphaelleheaf), especially when it comes to data. 

I believe in building products and services that people love, not just on what they want. I’m passionate about brands and love to make things happen.

I'm available for hire on a freelance basis.

*"I won't be surprised if Raphaelle becomes soon a "trend-maker" herself, I really believe she will be among the industry leaders in the near future."* [Christian Alves, Product Manager](https://uk.linkedin.com/in/raphaelleheaf)
