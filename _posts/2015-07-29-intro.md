# I'm a freelance communications designer
{: .text-purple}

I’m a freelance communications designer who specialises in helping to shape 21st century organisations through developing the culture and engagement from the inside out.

I've previously worked with a number of high growth startups, including my own, and in one of the world’s best technology teams, [Government Digital Service](https://gds.blog.gov.uk/about/)(GDS) to help them launch and grow their user base. I'm also a [social media marketer](https://www.instagram.com/raphaelleheaf/), an [entrepreneur](https://uk.linkedin.com/in/raphaelleheaf), a [blogger](https://140x365.com/) and a bit of a [geek](https://github.com/raphaelleheaf), especially when it comes to data. 

I’m passionate about making a real difference and love to make things happen. I’ve taken an idea to a funded business, grown and managed teams and developed advocates and communities locally and globally.

I'm [available for hire](mailto:raphaelle@raphaelleheaf.com) on a freelance basis. 


*"I won't be surprised if Raphaelle becomes soon a "trend-maker" herself, I really believe she will be among the industry leaders in the near future."* [Christian Alves, Product Manager](https://uk.linkedin.com/in/raphaelleheaf)
