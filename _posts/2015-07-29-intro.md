# Digital Marketing & Brand Development Specialist
{: .text-purple}

I’m a highly experienced and passionate freelance communications strategist. I previously worked at one of the world’s best technology teams at [Government Digital Service](https://gds.blog.gov.uk/about/). I'm also a marketer, an [entrepreneur](https://uk.linkedin.com/in/raphaelleheaf), a [blogger](http://nevercinderella.com/), a strategist and a bit of a [geek](https://instagram.com/raphaelleheaf/), especially when it comes to digital. 

I believe in building products and services that people love, not just on what they want. I’m passionate about brands and love to make things happen.

"I won't be surprised if Raphaelle becomes soon a "trend-maker" herself, I really believe she will be among the industry leaders in the near future." [Christian Alves, Product Manager](https://uk.linkedin.com/in/raphaelleheaf)
