# Brand Development, Digital Marketing & Social Media Specialist
{: .text-purple}


I’m a highly experienced and passionate communications manager currently working at one of the world’s best technology teams at Government Digital Service. I'm also a marketer, an entrepreneur, a blogger, a strategist and a bit of a geek, especially when it comes to digital. 

I believe in building products and services that people love, not just on what they want. I’m passionate about brands and love to make things happen.

I'm usually online so get in touch [email](mailto:raphaelle@raphaelleheaf.com), [twitter](https://twitter.com/raphaelleheaf) or [linkedin](https://uk.linkedin.com/in/raphaelleheaf)
