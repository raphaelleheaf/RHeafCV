# I'm a freelance communications designer
{: .text-purple}

I’m a freelance communications designer who specialises in helping to transform user experiences based on the right outcomes. Having originally studied Architecture, I have a passion for exploring the ways we interact with space both online and offline. I’m a half british, half french born Londoner.  I’ve lived and travelled across America, Asia and Europe and grew up in an art gallery.

I've previously worked with a number of high growth startups, including my own, and in one of the world’s best technology teams, [Government Digital Service](https://gds.blog.gov.uk/about/) to help them launch and grow their user base. I'm also a [social media marketer](https://www.instagram.com/raphaelleheaf/), an [entrepreneur](https://uk.linkedin.com/in/raphaelleheaf), a [blogger](https://140x365.com/) and a bit of a [geek](https://github.com/raphaelleheaf), especially when it comes to data. 

I believe in building products and services that people love. I’m passionate about services that make a real difference to the lives of the people around us.

I'm [available for hire](mailto:raphaelle@raphaelleheaf.com) on a freelance basis. 
(Or, you never know, for the right role you I might consider stepping back into something permanent).

*"I won't be surprised if Raphaelle becomes soon a "trend-maker" herself, I really believe she will be among the industry leaders in the near future."* [Christian Alves, Product Manager](https://uk.linkedin.com/in/raphaelleheaf)
